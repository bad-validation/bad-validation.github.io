    <h1>Bad Validation Project</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Ever since obtaining a domain from the (semi)recent release of <abbr title="Top Level Domain">TLD</abbr> I have been frustrated by the number of web sites (including many major sites) that impliment bad email validation rules. This prevents the use of perfectly valid email addresses. Initially I started to alert sites to the problem via twitter, many responded and fixed the issues (some in under 4 hours), some did not, some used bogus "security" claims<sup>1</sup> to justify not making a change. While this approach has worked I've found the problem to be much more widespead</p>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This project is to automate the process of alerting site admins to instances of bad validation rules as well as to educate developers and admins on ways of implimenting validation that correctly validates email addresses.</p>
    <h2>Status</h2>
    <p>As should be evident from the VERY plain website this is early days and I've yet to flesh out the design of the notification process. The process needs to be automated but also informative to the sites being notified of the problem.</p>
